  Patches from Roine: support NBZ files within SAR archives, and fix
  the xcode project.


2008-01-03

  Numerous patches from Mion of Sonozaki Futago-tachi:
    * Fix bugs in prnum
    * Remove extra newlines in built-in save/load menus
    * Modify skip-to-wait mode to fix Higurashi problems
    * Allow multiple archive paths, to facilitate distributing patches
    * Fix intermittent crashes with multicore processors
    * Fix input breakage in auto mode


2007-11-11

  Simplify handling of the click-wait enum.

  Temporarily disable skip_to_wait; there's breakage somewhere that's
  causing nasty side-effects in Higurashi.


2007-07-20

  Adjust btnwait to match NScripter behaviour more closely.  (Further
  tests are required to confirm that this doesn't break any edge
  cases.)


2007-06-20

  Fix an OS X bug causing bundled games to fail.


2007-06-12

  Get the build working on Solaris (a useful benchmark for how well
  things work on less Linux-like platforms) and NetBSD (a useful step
  towards my ultimate goal of a visual novel on every toaster).

  Fix some more MinGW build errors.

  Add the missing `install' target.


2007-06-07

  Fix some errors when mixing internal and system libraries.
  Improve support for FreeBSD.


2007-05-13

  Attempt to detect when a PNG image is using an NScripter-style mask
  area for transparency rather than a PNG alpha channel; add
  command-line flags and compile-time options to force either
  behaviour if auto-detection fails.  This should fix games like
  Tsukihime which were broken by the addition of alpha channel
  support.


2007-05-06

  Fix some bugs: parsing of arguments, saving of vertical text,
  and compilation without INSANI defined.


2007-05-01

  Merge in some more changes from Roine designed to make life better
  for OS X users:

  Include an Xcode project to simplify Mac builds.

  If game resources are not in the app's bundle, look for them in the
  application path instead.

  Store saves and other data under Application Support, not
  Preferences.


2007-04-27

  Merge in Roine's scaling patch.  This is considered experimental,
  and will currently only be enabled if RCA_SCALE is defined at
  compile-time.

  Fix a silly bug in the previous mergings.


2007-04-25

  Merge in an adapted version of the `drawfix' patch to speed up
  screen updates in windowed mode, plus a number of other patches:

  Support both SAR and NSA archives at the same time (zalas)

  Reduce flicker when sprites are changed (Roine Gustafsson)

  Fix gcc detection on OS X (Roine)

  Display missing game data error as a dialog on OS X (Roine)

  Support multiple games without game IDs at the same time (Roine)

  Fix incorrect clipping of text shadow (Roine)


2007-04-15

  Merge in useful fixes from onscripter-20070206.


2007-04-08

  Update build system to use a configure script that generates a
  platform-appropriate makefile.  This also verifies that all required
  dependencies are available, and provides the option of building
  local libraries as required.  The end result is a package that can
  reasonably be distributed in source form for Linux users.
  In the process support for PSP, iPod, etc. has been removed; it
  could be replaced easily enough if anyone was available to test.

  Translate README.

  To make life easier with existing games, add the ability to store
  game ID in a file `game.id' as an alternative to modifying 0.txt.


2006-11-22

  Implement default data/save separation for Windows and Linux too.
  On Windows, saves go under the global Application Data folder; on
  Linux and other Unix-like systems, they go in a dotdir in the user's
  home directory.  These changes enhance Vista compatibility
  considerably, and make it possible to package Linux games in a way
  that respects the FHS.


2006-09-05

  Fix typo in usage summary.
  
  Remove unnecessary diagnostics.

  Make archive path and save path separately configurable.  Game data
  no longer has to be stored in a writable directory.
  
  OS X: make default archive path be the Resources folder of the
  application bundle, and default save path be a new subfolder of the
  user's Library/Preferences.  The name of the subfolder is derived
  from a new "game identifier" that should be specified at the top of
  0.txt with a ";gameid Whatever" line immediately after the modeline.
